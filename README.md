The stats.c and stats.h files have some premade function comment format for you to enter data into. You will need to include your name as the author, the date, and a small description of the file at the top. If you open stats.c you will see you have been given part of a main() function. Main has defined an array of 40 characters for testing. At the top of README.md, add your name and description of the repository and project.

stats.c contains  eight functions namel :

    main() - The main entry point for your program
    print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
    print_array() - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
    find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
    find_mean() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
    find_maximum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
    find_minimum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
    sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest. (The zeroth Element should be the largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )

Most of the functions in the stats.c file require 2 input parameters and one return value:

    Input: A unsigned char pointer to an n-element data array
    Input: An unsigned integer as the size of the array
    Output: An unsigned char result from the function

About the header file stat.h

    The stats.h header file needs to include declarations and documentation for the functions from the stats.c file.
